I have sentences that come and go; they try to get hold of me, chase me, make me smile, and have me write about them at 12:33 am. They love me, and I love them back. Welcome to their home, our home on the internet.

Oh, you want to know more about me? (chuckles) Sure. I'm Keshav, an object designer who lives right in the middle of the forest that weaves art and technology.

Currently, I'm learning SwiftUI because I believe code is the most sophisticated design tool on the planet, and I want to be friends with her. Yes, language is a living entity for me.
