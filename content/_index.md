I have [sentences](/tags/sentence) that come and go; they try to get hold of me, chase me, make me smile, and have me write about them at 12:33 am. Welcome to their home, our home on the internet. I'm Keshav, an object designer who lives right in the middle of the forest that weaves art and technology.

Currently, I'm learning SwiftUI because I believe code is the most sophisticated design tool on the planet, and I want my narratives to come alive.
