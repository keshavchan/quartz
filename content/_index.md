You might be tired from roaming around on the internet. Please take a moment to quench your thirst. Here, have a glass of water. Seriously, just go and grab one. I am Keshav, a software designer currently researching spatial computing and machine learning on weekends. 

At present, I'm just having a lot of fun writing about new ways of [[website/yt|employment]].
